# Weight-Scale-using-Load-Cells
0-5 kg range digital weight scale design using load cells.
The objective of this project is to design a weight scale using loadcells, which can measure weight in the 0-5 kg range with 10g accuracy in measuring. The weight scale has been designed using the AtMega328p microcontroller and we have used the Atmel Studio platform to program the chip and Orcad to design the layouts of the PCB and also, we have used Multisim for simulations.
